# Elm Color Mixing

At the moment this package is just a stub.  

My plan is to cover all color functions that are documented in the LessCss CSS preprocessor:

[http://lesscss.org/functions/#color-operations](http://lesscss.org/functions/#color-operations)

And to use the [Core Color type](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/2.1.0/Color) provided by Elm.
